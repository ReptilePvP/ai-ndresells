Now can you help me create a prompt that will add these new settings and feature. 
I want to add the option for the user to be able to pick between which api search service they are using.
On the users account setting page, I want them to be able to decide between using these api search services :

* Gemini : Already setup 
* Search API :( API = bGfCEz5mAFmEc6mMA4L6ptYP ) and here is the documents to set it up https://www.searchapi.io/docs/google-lens 
* SerpAPI : ( API = 0df2fcc3b6090d2083f7e1840e585f994b0d0b5339a53c77c4d30a7760701e60 ) and here is the doucments to set it up https://serpapi.com/google-lens-api

Also to note that only one can be selected to use at the time please have to set to pull a comparison photo beside the
users uploaded image & all results to be formatted the same  



I want to add a feature where users can choose which image analysis API to use (only one at a time) from their Account Settings page. The options are:

Gemini (Already setup)

SearchAPI (API Key: bGfCEz5mAFmEc6mMA4L6ptYP) [Docs: https://www.searchapi.io/docs/google-lens]

SerpAPI (API Key: 0df2fcc3b6090d2083f7e1840e585f994b0d0b5339a53c77c4d30a7760701e60) [Docs: https://serpapi.com/google-lens-api]

üîß Functional Requirements:

Add a user setting that stores their selected API provider.

Update the Account Settings page UI to let users choose between ‚ÄúGemini,‚Äù ‚ÄúSearchAPI,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSerpAPI.‚Äù Only one can be selected at a time.

When an image is uploaded, the backend should:

Detect the user‚Äôs selected API

Call the correct image analysis API (Gemini, SearchAPI, or SerpAPI)


On the results page, display:

User‚Äôs uploaded image

Comparison image (from the API result)

Product title, price range, resell value, and description


üí° Please generate:

UserSettingsContext hook to read & update preferred API

AccountSettings UI (React component with dropdown or radio buttons)

Backend logic to route to the selected API with proper formatting

Parsers for all three API responses (SearchAPI, SerpAPI, Gemini) into the same structure


Bonus if you can include:

Input validation (only 1 service selected)

Fallback error handling for failed API calls

Design suggestions for side-by-side comparison image layout
