# Project Progress

## What Works

The application is fully functional and meets the core requirements outlined in the project brief.

- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Image Analysis:** The image upload and analysis pipeline is working reliably, integrating with Google Gemini and other APIs.
- **Data Persistence:** All data (users, uploads, analyses, feedback) is correctly persisted in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Frontend UI:** The React client provides a functional interface for all user-facing features.
- **Admin Dashboard:** The admin section is operational, providing key stats and data views.
- **Live Analysis:** The WebSocket-based live analysis feature is implemented.

## What's Left to Build

As the core functionality is complete, future work will focus on enhancements and new features:

- **Expanded Platform Support:** Integrate with more e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, Facebook Marketplace) for broader market data.
- **Historical Price Tracking:** Implement features to track the value of specific items over time.
- **Improved UI/UX:** Refine the user interface based on user feedback.
- **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize database queries and API response times.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Provide users with more detailed analytics and trends in their saved items.

## Current Status

The project is in a stable, production-ready state. The current focus is on monitoring system performance, gathering user feedback, and planning for the next phase of development.

## Known Issues

- **[Resolved]** `searchapi` and `serpapi` services were failing due to incorrect URL construction for image analysis. This has been fixed by prioritizing the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable.
- The system's reliance on external APIs means that it is vulnerable to their outages, which should be monitored.
