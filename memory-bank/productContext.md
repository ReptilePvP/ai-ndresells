# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Resellers and individuals often struggle to determine the fair market value of a product quickly and accurately. This process involves manually searching multiple online marketplaces, comparing listings, and trying to account for variables like condition and demand. This is time-consuming, inefficient, and can lead to poor pricing decisions, either leaving money on the table or failing to make a sale.

## User Stories

- **As a reseller,** I want to take a picture of an item and instantly get its current market value and demand, so that I can make a profitable sourcing decision on the spot.
- **As an individual,** I want to easily find out what my old electronics or collectibles are worth, so I can decide whether to sell them.
- **As a power reseller,** I want to see aggregated pricing data from eBay and StockX in one place, so I don't have to check each platform individually.
- **As a user,** I want to save my past analyses to track the value of items over time.
- **As an administrator,** I want to monitor the system's health and user activity to ensure the platform is running smoothly.

## User Experience (UX) Goals

- **Speed:** The analysis process should be as close to real-time as possible, providing results within seconds.
- **Simplicity:** The user interface should be intuitive, allowing users to get a valuation with minimal effort (i.e., just uploading a photo).
- **Trustworthiness:** The data presented must be perceived as accurate and reliable, with clear sourcing and confidence scores.
- **Actionable Insights:** The results should be easy to understand and provide clear, actionable intelligence for the user.

## Competitive Landscape

- **Existing Solutions:** Users currently rely on manually checking individual marketplace apps (eBay, StockX), using general search engines, or dedicated price-tracking websites.
- **Strengths of Competitors:** Established user bases and large datasets (e.g., eBay's Terapeak).
- **Weaknesses of Competitors:** Often require manual search input, lack multi-platform aggregation, and do not offer instant image-based analysis. This platform's key differentiator is its ability to combine image recognition with real-time, multi-platform market data aggregation.
