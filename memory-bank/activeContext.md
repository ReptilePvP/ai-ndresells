# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on ensuring the stability and reliability of the production system. This includes monitoring API performance, database health, and user activity through the admin dashboard.

## Recent Changes

- The memory bank documentation has been fully populated to provide a comprehensive overview of the project.
- No functional code changes have been made in this session.

## Next Steps

- Monitor the system for any issues that may arise.
- Gather user feedback to inform the next cycle of development.
- Begin planning for the implementation of new features as outlined in `progress.md`, such as expanded platform support and historical price tracking.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **API Cost Management:** Keep a close watch on the usage of paid APIs like Google Gemini to ensure costs remain within budget. The caching strategy is a key component of this.
- **Scalability:** As the user base grows, it will be important to monitor database performance and server load to determine when scaling measures (e.g., database replicas, load balancing) may be necessary.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Maintain Comprehensive Documentation:** The memory bank is critical for project continuity and should be kept up-to-date with any significant changes.
- **Prioritize Type Safety:** Continue to leverage TypeScript and Zod to maintain a high level of type safety throughout the codebase.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** While not explicitly used so far, adopting a TDD approach for new features would be beneficial for long-term stability.
